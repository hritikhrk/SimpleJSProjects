# background-image-slider Project Description
This project is very similar to the Testimonials JavaScript Project. I did find it a lot easier, however. For this image slider, when an arrow is clicked, the next image in the array shows up.
#### What You Should See
1. A default image should be displayed when you load the page.
2. When you click the “left” button, one of five images should display, all the way until each of the five numbers display in sequence.
3. Repeat step 2 for the “right” button.
