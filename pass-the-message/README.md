# pass-the-message

This project challenges us to select the input element's value from the DOM. When you click on the “Submit” button you'll see the message inputted in the box in the “Last Message Delivered” Section.

#### What you should see:
1. After you enter text into the input box, upon pressing the “Enter” key, your message should show up in the “Last Message Delivered” Section.

2. After the “Enter” key is pressed, the text box value should return to an empty text box.

3. If no input is submitted, an alert should show (using the ‘show' class in the CSS file) in the “Last Message Delivered” section and then disappear after 2 second.
